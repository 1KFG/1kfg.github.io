# 1KFG project progress

A quick update on this site to report we are continuing to sequence genomes at a fast pace due to the efforts of the DOE JGIâ€™s work and collaborating labs preparing DNA and RNA. The number of genomes in the [Mycocosm system](http://jgi.doe.gov/fungi) is now [more than 1000](https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/fungi/fungi.info.html) and the 1KFG project has contributed many hundred to this effort. We are working phylogenetic and comparative genomic papers to describe more of what can be learned from these data about the evolution and biology of fungi.
