# 1000 Fungal Genomes

The 1000+ fungal genomes project is an effort to sample the genomic diversity of the fungal kingdom focusing on phylogenetic diversity.  

One phase of the project supported by a [Community Sequencing Project](https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/mycocosm/home/1000-fungal-genomes) at the Joint Genome Institute.
See the currently sampled strains across the kingdom and you can also [nominate more species](https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/pages/fungi-1000-projects.jsf) particularly in Families with less than 2 genomes. It is also possible to nominate more than 2 for a Family should there be a suitable justification that contribute to the DOE mission.
